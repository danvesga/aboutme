                            JavaScript is the world most
                            popular lightweight, interpreted
                            compiled programming language.
                            It is also known as scripting
                            language for web pages. It is
                            well-known for the development
                            of web page many non-browser
                            environments also use it.
                            JavaScript can be used for
                            Client-side developments as well

                            When compared with C++, Java
                            codes are generally more
                            maintainable because Java does
                            not allow many things which may
                            lead to bad/inefficient
                            programming if used incorrectly.
                            For example, non-primitives are
                            always references in Java. So we
                            cannot pass large objects (like
                            we can do in C++) to functions,
                            we always pass references in
                            Java. One more example, since
                            there are no pointers, bad
                            memory access is also not
                            possible. When compared with
                            Python, Java kind of fits
                            between C++ and Python. The
                            programs are written in Java
                            typically run faster than
                            corresponding Python programs
                            and slower than C++. Like C++,
                            Java does static type checking,
                            but Python does not.
